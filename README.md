# Verilog Projects Repository

Welcome to my Verilog repository! This collection contains various Verilog modules and testbenches designed to help with understanding, simulating, and implementing digital logic circuits.

## Contents

This repository includes the following files:

- **Modules (.v)**: Verilog files containing the logic definitions for different digital circuits.
- **Testbenches (\*_tb.v)**: Testbenches to validate and simulate the corresponding Verilog modules.
- **Simulation Output (\*.vcd)**: Waveform files generated from simulations.
- **Other Supporting Files**: Additional files that assist in simulations and testing.

### Examples of Modules in This Repository:
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: A simple ALU implementation.
- **Multiplexer (MUX)**: A 16-to-1 multiplexer.
- **Other Digital Logic**: Additional examples and experiments in Verilog.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To work with the files in this repository, you will need:
- A Verilog simulation tool (e.g., **ModelSim**, **Xilinx Vivado**, **Icarus Verilog**, or **Synopsys VCS**)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., **VS Code** with Verilog extensions)

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local system:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sohampalkrit/verilog-projects.git
   ```
2. Open the desired module and its testbench in your Verilog simulator.
3. Run the simulation to observe the behavior and waveforms.

## Learning Objectives

This repository is suitable for:
- Beginners learning the basics of Verilog.
- Students practicing digital design concepts such as combinational and sequential logic.
- Engineers exploring simulation and testing techniques.
