# Digital Systems Repository by Soham Palkrit

## Introduction

This repository, created by **Soham Palkrit**, is dedicated to designing, simulating, and implementing digital systems using **Verilog HDL**. It contains several modules, testbenches, and simulation outputs that demonstrate fundamental concepts in digital design.

The primary goal of this project is to create reusable, modular Verilog implementations while gaining a deeper understanding of digital electronics and hardware description languages.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this repository are:
- To design and implement digital systems, focusing on clarity, reusability, and modularity.
- To simulate and verify the functionality of each module through testbenches and waveform generation.
- To explore concepts in combinational and sequential logic design, including arithmetic operations, multiplexing, and basic digital system simulations.

## Modules Overview

This repository includes the following Verilog modules and supporting files:

- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Implements arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR.
- **Multiplexer (MUX):** A 16-to-1 multiplexer designed for efficient data selection.
- **Hello World Example:** A simple introductory Verilog module for beginners.
- **Testbenches:** Accompanying each module to verify its functionality.
- **Simulation Outputs (.vcd):** Visualizes the simulation results using waveform viewers.

## Key Features

1. **Testbench Integration:** Each module has a dedicated testbench for verifying functionality and ensuring correctness.
2. **Simulation Results:** Waveform files (*.vcd) are included for visual debugging and performance validation.
3. **Combinational and Sequential Designs:** Covers basic and advanced digital design concepts.
4. **Beginner-Friendly Examples:** Includes simple modules to get started with Verilog.

## Usage and Workflow

To work with the modules and testbenches:

### Prerequisites
- Install a Verilog simulator such as **Icarus Verilog**, **ModelSim**, or **Xilinx Vivado**.
- Use a text editor or IDE with Verilog support (e.g., **VS Code** with Verilog extensions).

### Steps to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local system:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sohampalkrit/digital-systems-repo.git
